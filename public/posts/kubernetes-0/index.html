<h2 id="where-it-started">Where it started?</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with, say you a service and a bunch of computers. Your service is pretty cool, and one computer is not enough to serve it, so you decide to use 7 of those computers you have to serve it. How you decide to do that is you set those computer&rsquo;s on your local network, install docker(Read about docker if you don&rsquo;t know what it is, the intuition is pretty simple on why) and run the docker image of your service on all of them. On one of them you decide to run a <a href="https://youtu.be/SqqrOspasag?si=G79xzA4PKiTskth5">reverse-proxy</a> and this reverse-proxy then distributes a request to the other computers. Sounds good&hellip; I guess? But I can think of a few problems with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do you actually run the docker image on all these computers? Do you always manually get a terminal on them and docker run it? You probably would write a script that can SSH into each of them and do a docker run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens when you want to release the next version of your app? This can have a LOT of problems, do you just run the script again with the new docker image and update all computers at once? What if your new update is bad, and computers start crashing, then you have to run the script again with the lower version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens with failures? if a computer crashes? That means you need someone to monitor all these computers, and if one of them dies you bring another one up. You can maybe write a script that has a ping on your service with a infinite for loop and a sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a computer fails, you have to also update your reverse-proxy to point at the new IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens if the computer that runs the reverse proxy itself fails? Now this is a big problem, because now your service has downtime. You need to run and setup a new reverse-proxy ASAP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-comes-kubernetes">In comes kubernetes</h2>
<p>Now say you are very annoyed by these issues, and you decide to give kubernetes a shot. So you somehow setup a kubernetes cluster with those computers. Before we get to how kubernetes solves these issues, let&rsquo;s break down a little terminology.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In kubernetes world, you call these computers as nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On these nodes, you can run docker containers. A container running on a node is called a pod (Generally there are more than one containers running in a pod but it&rsquo;s ok for now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kubernetes has magic resources that can create pods for you. One such resource is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">deployment</a>, which essentially creates a bunch of pods for you, and makes sure the cluster always has those many pods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how kubernetes solves these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How you actually run the docker images? Kubernetes has a control plain which you can think of as your SSH script. The control plain can talk to your nodes(computers) and tell them to create a pod (having your docker container) on it. And generally you will do it using a kubernetes deployment to create a bunch of pods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to do next version release? Same thing, you just update your deployment and control plan takes care of recreating all the pods with the new docker image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How it handles failures? Just as you would do a infinite while loop with sleep, kubernetes does that also with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">health checks</a>. Kubernetes runs this loop for you and if the ping to your service fails, kubernetes creates another pod with your container on it, removes the refrences like IP of the old pod from everywhere and adds the new pod.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How kubernetes makes traffic to pods routable is using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">kubernetes services</a>. A service can be thought of as a entry in a DB, where the service name is the key, and a list of pods is the value. This way when a pod dies, kubernetes just updates the DB entry with the IP of the new node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So now kubernetes has solved all your problems. This is essentially most of what kubernetes is used for(from a noobs perspective). There still is a question on how to get traffic from <code>www.foo.com</code> to your kubernetes service. A short version of that is, you define a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">kubernetes ingress</a>. Send traffic to your cluster&rsquo;s ingress using an external LB like route53, and then the ingress will send traffic to your service. The details of this is for another day.</p>
